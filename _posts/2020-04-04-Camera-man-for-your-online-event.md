titile: Camera man for your next online event.
desc: Now that your events are happening online, do you need to hire a cameraman?

Since people are hanging out online more eg. you must have read they are having virtual parties, getting married and conducting virtual weddings,Â lol. We can have a virtual "cameraman" of a sort that captures interesting moments/expressions of these events and come up with a summary video or an album for that event.

It could be a desktop app that records and captures your zoom recordings in the beginning and one can later extend it for other software/systems.
