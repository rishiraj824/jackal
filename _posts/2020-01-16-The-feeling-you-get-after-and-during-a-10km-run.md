Ever did this before? If your answer is yes, then read along, you'll definitely relate to it. It's not the same feeling what you get after playing any sport. If your answer is no, then its highly likely you will try it after reading this.

You start like any normal person would, you tell yourself you don't want to sprint as you want to cover the whole park, maybe two rounds of the park. You see people crossing you and you crossing some people. Not all of them are on the same number of laps as you.

Your legs are the most easily forgiving parts of your body. Is this true? No its the most resilient one, the people who are able to do marathons and run cross-countries have trained themselves over the years to make it the most resilient muscle of their body.

The pain begins right below your calf muscles and in between your shins. Its like there is a creature between those two bones and it wants to get out. Your body slows down as you react to it but your eyes don't look down as you still want the feeling after the run to be as immense as possible. 

Your heart beat is the next sound after the thumping of your foot on the ground. You try to change the landing of your foot on the ground so that some muscles slow down and rest. The best way to breathe during a long run like this is perused breathing as the air goes deep into your lungs.

And midway between your run when you realise that you're halfway there, you try to sprint a little bit because you come across a downhill. Your legs thank you at this moment because they are making use of the friction, your speed is maximum and your eyes are a little watery and your sweat drops from your forehead are just the part of this perfect scene.

While you can see that you're closing up you have a crazy burst of energy from inside which shows up suddenly at the moment. It gives you the immense strength which helps you reach that end. 

After the run when you reach for your phone while drinking water from your sipper and trying to breathe as much as possible you get the best feeling to see your trace and the distance you covered today.
