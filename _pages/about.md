  I have a fondness and passion for Web Technologies and have a good amount of experience
  in the same. I love working on **AngularJS (1.0,2.0), React-Redux, Laravel and Wordpress**. Most of the time which I
  spend is on my laptop -- working on projects, building something new and exploring new methods and frameworks in Web. The
  rest of the time, I love going to different places, trying out new restaurants and meeting new people. 

  I am currently in the 6th Semester of my *Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science* which I am pursuing from *VIT University, Vellore.*

## My Interests and Hobbies

I love watching TV Series and Movies in my part time. The favourite one is too tough to 
decide as it keeps changing, though I love *Breaking Bad* and *Friends*. Recently, I have started following
*Westworld* and I love the way Jonathan Nolan has brought the concepts of
Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction to reality. Other than these, I have watched *Daredevils, Suits, Game of Thrones, 
How I Met Your Mother, Two and a Half Men, Prison Break* and many more which I can't recall as of now.

I like listening to *Electronic Music/Hip-Pop/R&B* and follow the latest
and top songs from *Spotify*. I am planning to learn a musical
instrument soon in the future. Well, my favourite artists include
*Chainsmokers, Avicii, Hardwell, Dimitri Vegas, Coldplay* and there is an endless list. I have a fondness of Bollywood songs too. Some
of the amazing artists which I like are *Sonu Nigam, Arijit Singh, Armaan Malik and A.R.Rehman.*

I love following political debates and have my own views towards them. In Sports, I am a fan of *M.S. Dhoni, the captain of Indian Cricket Team, 
Wayne Rooney from Manchester United, and Lionel Messi from Barcelona*. In International Football matches I support *Germany* because India never gave me 
a chance to support them till now but I believe it will one day. These are the two most important sports which I follow as well as play when I get time.
